							<h2>Areas of
								Expertise</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Marketing Hacker.webp" alt="" /></span>
										<p>My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages,
											problem solving, responsive design principles, website optimization, and the Model
											View View Model (MVVM) and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing
											code.</br>
											<b>Skills :<br />
											<b>Product Management > 2-year startup experience, bootstrapped from scratch to a working product with 1000+ users. Also, dashboards, branding, UI/UX, ...</b><br />
											<b></b>Online Advertising > 2+ years of experience facing media agencies & direct advertisers. Multi-channel campaign optimization (Digital audiences, retargeting, engagement, Content syn...)<br />
											<b></b>Web Marketing > Web Analytics (conversion funnel, metrics), Adwords, E-mailing, A/B testing<br />
											<b></b>SEO > Most recent best practices (long-trail, micro-formats), full diagnostics and optimization plans<br />
											<b></b>Web Development > HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Django, SQL <br /></b>
											I've started learning Adobe Analytics and MERN Stack. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto
										any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the
										coding web in my head. Being in an Engineering college not only I've learnt to manage my time efficiently but eventually I realized my true calling was <b> Product Management and Engineering</b> <br />
	
										</b><h3>Unveiling My Journey: From Code Enthusiast to Product Maestro.</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Tanishqabout.jpg" alt="" /></span>Greetings, fellow curious minds! Armed with a B.E. in Computer Science & Technology, I embarked on a quest to decode the universe of gadgets and tech trends. You know, the classic dream – coding away in a corporate giant, with a cup of coffee as my trusty sidekick, crafting apps that make life easier than solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded. But then, the siren call of marketing, product management, quality control, network engineering, and cybersecurity hit me. Because, why stick to just one flavor of excitement when you can have a smorgasbord, right? My inner spark was napping, but no worries – it woke up faster than a snooze button on a Monday morning when I played my first "Exponent Product Management and Product School" video. No, seriously, what could be more electrifying than that?
								<b>Product Management and Front-end web development calls to all my passions;</b> A canvas where I'm free to break, improve, and shape the code, like an artist at work. The responsive design principles, oh, how I adore them! Watching my web pages gracefully morph across screens, still impeccable – it's an oddly satisfying magic I can't get enough of. Just like those pages, I'm adaptable yet fiercely retaining my creative flare.</p>

							<h2>Beyond Bytes: Downtime Adventures of a Pixel Warrior</h2>
							<p>Now, when I'm not befriending lines of code, you'll find me mastering the art of leisure. Gaming? Oh, absolutely. I've achieved digital greatness, which, let's be real, is almost like being a superhero. A sponsored E-sport athlete for White Unicorn Esports – I mean, they don't hand those out to just anyone! As the saying goes, "We don't stop gaming because we grow old; we grow old because we stop gaming." And I? I'm still on Level Epic.Between tactical chess moves, meme marathons, and staying updated with news (because adulting, right?), I find solace in a more primal connection – Planet Earth. It's like my very own Netflix show, reminding me that the world's wonders are greater than any bug in a code.</p>
							<h2>Pioneering Dreams: From Clicks to Cliques in Cyberland</h2>
							<p>India's E-sports arena isn't just my playground; it's my realm of influence. As an E-sport influencer and advocate, I'm basically the Gandalf of this realm, rallying the troops and summoning fellow adventurers. Representing my nation in E-sports conferences and fairs, I've spread the message like Gandalf with a megaphone, because, why not? And now, brace yourselves, a new chapter is unfolding. I'm scripting a saga to launch my own E-sports team, ready to conquer continents and make pixels bow in respect. It's the tech-meets-gaming-meets-network-engineering-and-cybersecurity adventure we didn't know we needed. So, welcome to my journey – where tech spells excitement, gaming is an art form, and I? Well, I'm the magician of the digital realm. Now, who's up for some code-infused magic tricks?</p>
