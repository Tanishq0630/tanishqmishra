							<h2>Areas of
								Expertise</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Marketing Hacker.webp" alt="" /></span>
										<p>My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages,
											problem solving, responsive design principles, website optimization, and the Model
											View View Model (MVVM) and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing
											code.</br>
											<b>Skills :<br />
											<b>Product Management > 2-year startup experience, bootstrapped from scratch to a working product with 1000+ users. Also, dashboards, branding, UI/UX, ...</b><br />
											<b></b>Online Advertising > 2+ years of experience facing media agencies & direct advertisers. Multi-channel campaign optimization (Digital audiences, retargeting, engagement, Content syn...)<br />
											<b></b>Web Marketing > Web Analytics (conversion funnel, metrics), Adwords, E-mailing, A/B testing<br />
											<b></b>SEO > Most recent best practices (long-trail, micro-formats), full diagnostics and optimization plans<br />
											<b></b>Web Development > HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Django, SQL <br /></b>
											I've started learning Adobe Analytics and MERN Stack. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto
										any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the
										coding web in my head. Being in an Engineering college not only I've learnt to manage my time efficiently but eventually I realized my true calling was <b> Product Management and Engineering</b> <br />
	
										</b><h3>Unveiling My Journey: From Code Enthusiast to Product Maestro.</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Tanishqabout.jpg" alt="" /></span>I always thought my dream was to be just a Software engineer at a giant company, sipping my coffee and coding my way to the next app which people find the most convenient. It seemed like a perfect dream to start with a B.E in Computer Science & Technology. I am enthusiastic and excited about things in day-to-day life and was always fascinated by new gadgets, technology and trends. My curiosity is my strength it allows me to generate the tenacity and willingness to learn new things be it in professional and personal life.
								I gravitated toward marketing and product management and quality control positions, and I started to work for a company like this. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.
								And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked
								play on my first Product Management video. (I mean seriously, how could it not be great
								when it's named after Monty Product Marketing School) Since then, I can't get enough.
								<b>Product Management and Front-end web development calls to all my passions;</b> It incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Gitbranch, of course).
								I also loved applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into
								mobile screens and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind
								of like those web pages, I'm moldable, but I keep my creative flare intact.</p>

							<h2>Interests & Hobbies </h2>
							<p>My interests in my leisure time are Gaming, memes, reading news, playing chess and I love the show Planet Earth because let's be honest that show is lit. Speaking about my interests, I mentioned gaming first as I’ve achieved a lot from gaming which reminds me of a saying, <b>“We don’t stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing”.</b> Maybe I never grew old as I am still <b>a sponsored E-sport athlete for White Unicorn Esports representing India and an E-sport influencer in my country, I have been representing my country for the last 3 years in India from 2018-2021, </b> spreading awareness about E-sports and encouraging youth to join E-sports in several conferneces and fairs as it is considered a small market in India and am currently working hard towards starting my own E-sports team to compete in Asia.</p>
